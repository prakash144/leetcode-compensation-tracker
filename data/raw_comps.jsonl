When my interviews got scheduled I just went through some standard medium/Hard problems. For most of the companies doing leetcode is enough.

Ideally at 2+ years exp you are already aware of most of the basics of LLD so go through the basics of LLD and then apply your day to day Dev skills to frame the answer (please refer some standard questions online and then frame the answer that way). \\n\\t For HLD you can follow CodeKarle youTube channel, that covers all the basics of hld and he has covered all the standard questions. You can watch those and form your solutions according to that because any question can be answered using basics of hld and standard questions that are already available on youtube.\\n\\nOne more important note please give some mock interviews for algorithms and system design both and do not take hr round very lightly, please prepare for behavioural questions seriously before your hr/hm round. \\n\\nHow Did I apply : I applied thourgh referral, one of college seniors referred me in August end.\\nOther companies that I interviewed with : Zepto and got a call from Goldman for associate but my joining date was already very near by that time.

When my interviews got scheduled I just went through some standard medium/Hard problems. For most of the companies doing leetcode is enough.

Ideally at 2+ years exp you are already aware of most of the basics of LLD so go through the basics of LLD and then apply your day to day Dev skills to frame the answer (please refer some standard questions online and then frame the answer that way). \\n\\t For HLD you can follow CodeKarle youTube channel, that covers all the basics of hld and he has covered all the standard questions. You can watch those and form your solutions according to that because any question can be answered using basics of hld and standard questions that are already available on youtube.\\n\\nOne more important note please give some mock interviews for algorithms and system design both and do not take hr round very lightly, please prepare for behavioural questions seriously before your hr/hm round. \\n\\nHow Did I apply : I applied thourgh referral, one of college seniors referred me in August end.\\nOther companies that I interviewed with : Zepto and got a call from Goldman for associate but my joining date was already very near by that time.

Also they mentioned my level as Manager(Sr. Software Engineer B3) as they have to match the bands internally but I like to be on IC roles.\\n\\nNot sure what\\'s happening in the market. Shocked to see cogni paying such high amount. \\nFor me to decide the offer, I want to go outside India(UK/Europe) for around 5 years and may get that chance in Cogni as I had some discussion with Project Managers. But again not sure what will happen after joining.\\n\\nIn JPMC, I can definately apply for IJP after a year but chances are not sure in that too. I am inclining to JPMC because of YOY hikes and bonus. For this band i think cogni will hike mostly 1% - 5%(too optimistic). But in JPMC, I think hike of 10% is kind of average and bonus is also around 10% - 12%.\\n\\nI know this have to be my decision but I need help in some inputs at this stage.

One challenge I always faced was knowing which questions to focus on for specific companies. I found myself constantly digging through discussion threads, trying to piece together what questions were recently asked where.\\n\\n## [The Solution](https://algorush.io/careerhub/company-search/)\\n\\nTo solve this problem for myself (and hopefully for others), I built a tool that:\\n\\n1. Parses recent LeetCode discussions\\n2. Aggregates mentions of interview questions for different companies\\n3. Presents this data in an easy-to-use format\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\n- Select a company you\\'re interested in\\n- View a list of recently mentioned interview questions for that company\\n- See details like question frequency, difficulty, and relevant topics\\n\\n## Additional Features\\n\\nWhile working on this project, I realized there were other areas where we could all use some help. So I added a few more sections:\\n\\n1. **[Practice Section](https://algorush.io/practice/)**: This includes a curated list of questions for:\\n   - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)\\n   - Low-Level Design (LLD)\\n   - Concurrency\\n   - High-Level Design (HLD)\\n   \\n   Each category has problems ranging from easy to hard, helping you build a well-rounded skill set.\\n\\n2. **[Tech Bytes](https://algorush.io/blogs/techbytes/)**: A dedicated section to keep you updated with the latest in tech. It includes:\\n   - Recent developments in popular technologies\\n   - New tools and frameworks\\n   - Industry trends and news\\n\\n   Staying informed about these can be really helpful during interviews and in your career generally.\\n\\n## What I Learned\\n\\nBuilding this was a great learning experience. Some challenges I faced:\\n- Dealing with unstructured text data from discussions\\n- Curating relevant and up-to-date content for the Tech Bytes section\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note:\\n- This tool only aggregates publicly shared information\\n- The data might not be 100% accurate or representative\\n- It\\'s meant to supplement your prep, not replace thorough studying\\n\\n## Sharing & Seeking Feedback\\n\\nYou can visit https://algorush.io/careerhub/company-search/  to try it out I\\'m not here to promote anything - I genuinely want to give back to this community that has helped me so much.\\n\\nI\\'d love to hear your thoughts:\\n- Is this something you find useful?\\n- What features would make it more helpful?\\n- Which section do you find most valuable?\\n\\nLet\\'s discuss in the comments.\\n\\n## A Small Request\\n\\nIf you find this website useful, please consider upvoting this post. It would help more people in our community to discover and benefit from it. Your support means a lot and helps me know if I should continue improving and maintaining this website.\\n\\nHappy coding, everyone!\\n![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/a26cc320-ca90-44f6-8953-3a16603c9ffd_1726124649.9149175.png)\\n", "vote_count": 0, "comment_count": 2, "view_count": 633, "creation_date": "2024-09-12 12:34:48"}
